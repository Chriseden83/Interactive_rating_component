## My process

### Built with

- React
- React State
- Tailwind CSS v4
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I enjoyed using react and getting to know the ins and outs of using state, conditional rendering. I used Tailwind CSS v4

### Continued development

More practice with React, state, Tailwind CSS, themes, animations. I need to become more profficient in laying out JSX tage for styling purposes, i'm forever re-jigging elemets. I also need to dig a bit further into theme variables when using Tailwind.
